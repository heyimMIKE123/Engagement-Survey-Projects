# Construct Validation

 This folder is for our construct validation project. All materials for the construct validation process should be placed here. 
 
 We administered our 20 item engagement measure along with Sak's engagement measure, as well as the Utrech engagement scale. We also had at least one
 intent-to-quit measure (criterion validation), and two discriminant measures (household chores + how many pets you had)




Construct validation:
For convergent validity indices, we administered the 17-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [UWES; Schaufeli et al. (2002); Schaufeli & Bakker (2010)] as well as the Saks (2006) 12-item scale which aggregates to two scales: job and organizational engagement (see also Saks, 2019). 5

The English version of the UWES may actually be a translation (difficult to say for sure, however, as the test manual describes an original Dutch sample although the manual is written in English), and some items have odd grammar (for example, “I am proud on the work that I do”).

Two short scales from the Oregon Avocational Interest Scales [ORAIS; Goldberg (2010)] were retained for discriminant validitation - the 5-item “Pets” and 5-item “Game-Playing” scales were administered.



Criterion-related validation:
We administered a short 4-item intent-to-quit scale developed by Kelloway et al. (1999).
