	abstract = {Bifactor measurement models are increasingly being applied to personality and psychopathology measures (Reise, 2012). In this work, authors generally have emphasized model fit, and their typical conclusion is that a bifactor model provides a superior fit relative to alternative subordinate models. Often unexplored, however, are important statistical indices that can substantially improve the psychometric analysis of a measure. We provide a review of the particularly valuable statistical indices one can derive from bifactor models. They include omega reliability coefficients, factor determinacy, construct reliability, explained common variance, and percentage of uncontaminated correlations. We describe how these indices can be calculated and used to inform: (a) the quality of unit-weighted total and subscale score composites, as well as factor score estimates, and (b) the specification and quality of a measurement model in structural equation modeling.},

	abstract = {We provide an overview of and guidance for applying exploratory bifactor models to vocational research. First, we describe bifactor models and highlight their potential and actual applications in vocational psychology. Second, we review the theoretical bases of bifactor models and offer methodological guidance to correctly implement and interpret these models in practice. Third, we estimate a bifactor model in two vocational datasets to illustrate the concepts reviewed in this manuscript. The resulting models highlight novel insights in careers research (e.g., developmental performance feedback and personality [conscientiousness] modeling) that are made possible by leveraging bifactor measurement models. Overall, this manuscript provides a useful introduction to bifactor models to facilitate vocational behavior scholars and practitioners in thoughtfully producing and consuming bifactor models in their own research.},
